## CNN to classify digits based on a custom MNIST dataset

The jupyter notebook does the following-
```
1.Load MNIST dataset using custom functions

2.Apply suitable transformations and data cleaning techniques.

3.Flatten the images.

4.Build a multi-layered Convolutional neural network (CNN) and use it to classify between the 10 numerical digits.
```
An accuracy of 97.3% has been achieved when trained on a dataset of 18000 images.
